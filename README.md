# Learning angular
This is my adventure in learning angular.

The actually app is deployed on heroku at http://jacks-angular-demo.herokuapp.com/

It stores data in the localStorage. So it will be presistance per device unless you delete localStorage.

## Tools used
angular.js, browserify, gulp, bootstrap, LESS and flask(not much of a backend)
